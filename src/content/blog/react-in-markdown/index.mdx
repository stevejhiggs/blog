import Counter from "./counter";

I wanted to have the ability to inject react into markdown for this blog. Luckily Gatsby has a plugin called MDX that allows just this. You can see the changes needed [here](https://github.com/stevejhiggs/blog/commit/f538cb0b86f357192580ee42bc7bdddada87a741) and a fix for the rss generator [here](https://github.com/stevejhiggs/blog/commit/768f90f3b17000c21d0c644716e0f3b64a4e8937).

And just to prove it:

<Counter client:load />

## Including a component

All this requires is for you to import the component in the markdown file in the same way you would in a js file. Then call the the component as normal:

```jsx
import Counter from "../../../src/components/counter";

blah blah random markdown

<Counter/>

More random markdown
```
